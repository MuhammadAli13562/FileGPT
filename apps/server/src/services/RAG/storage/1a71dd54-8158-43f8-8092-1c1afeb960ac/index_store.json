PROJECTS                                                                                                                                                   \nE-commerce Storewebsite code  \nI developed a Next.js e-commerce store, integrating a cart system and Stripe payments seamlessly \nwith a Sanity Admin Dashboard. The frontend, powered by Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and React \nContext, leveraged the Sanity SDK with server actions for data fetching. To ensure real-time updates, I implemented web hooks for data synchronization between \nthe admin dashboard and the client-facing store. This allows administrators to effortlessly \nmanage inventory, reflecting changes instantly on the storefront. Social Media Appwebsite code  \nI designed and developed a responsive app using React, Tanstack Query, and Tailwind CSS, \ndeployed seamlessly via Vercel. The app offers essential functionalities such as creating, reading,\nsaving, and editing posts, enhancing interaction. To optimize performance , I used caching and pagination with React Query. Integrated Explore \nfunctionality, users can search and filter options for posts, dynamically rearranging content based \non recent activities\nReal time Chat appwebsite code  \nI conceptualized and developed a real-time chat application independently, crafting a responsive \nfront end using React, Tailwind CSS, and Redux Toolkit. Using selectors I ensured minimal re- \nrenders while enabling core features. Using socket-io events on client & server , I implemented real-time messaging & notifications. I engineered a robust REST API with JavaScript Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and Prisma\nORM for schema and queries. Deployed on Amazon EC2 with Nginx Load Balancer.
